Hi


If you want to try out the application,

- Install latest version of Java JDK on your system.
- Download the NewGame.java file from the 'Code' folder
- Open Command Prompt or Console
- Compile the java file using the command 'javac NewGame.java'
- It generates a bunch of java class files

- Download 'score.txt',  'demo.txt',   'Icon.png' from this folder
- Make sure to place them in the same folder as the main file

- Run the application using : "java NewGame"



****  :
- The score.txt file is just a text file to store your high score. Making changes to the contents of the file may result in undesired behaviour.
- The Icon.png file is the image which appears as the icon on the game window. You can create your own icon, name it as 'Icon.png' and save it in your game file folder
  It will be used as the icon for the game window  then.
- The demo.txt file contains all the words which appear in the game. You can add more new words to the file but EACH WORD SHOULD BE ON A NEW LINE
